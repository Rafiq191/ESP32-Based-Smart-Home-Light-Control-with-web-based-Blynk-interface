Home Automation Project using Esp32

Topic: Smart Home Light Control

Instructions:
Utilize theEsp32 to create a smart home light control system. Implement a web-based interface that allows users to control the on/off state and brightness of a virtual LED. Users should be able to access and control the LED from a computer or smartphone.

Simulation Example:
Esp32 to create the web-based interface and control the virtual LED. (Blynk)

Expected Result:
The simulated smart home light control system should have a user-friendly web interface that allows users to turn the virtual LED on/off and adjust its brightness.
